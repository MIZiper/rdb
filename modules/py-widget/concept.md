allow python script for execution
to process result files

but need to protect system from being inspected
or data being removed by the script

one solution is make the module as a docker
and map data to the container

the widget is kind of like PowerBI Python widget
but PowerBI only passes stat table into script
while rdb passes multiple formatted binary files
